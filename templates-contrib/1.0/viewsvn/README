ViewVC templates for subversion only (templates-viewsvn)

Warning:
Do not use this template set if you plan to view cvs repositories through ViewVC! 
The templates are heavily trimmed for Subversion needs. Special CVS features are 
untested, possibly disabled or broken.

Do not forget to modify include/header.ezt to include your logo and favicon.
