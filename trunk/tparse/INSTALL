	HOW TO INSTALL tparse
	
	Quick install
	-------------
	
type as root:

$ python Setup.py build_ext
in the /viewcvs/tparse directory will compile tparse.
Normally, you can find a tparse.so dynamic library, in a directory called
build/lib.****/
where **** depends on OS.
cd into that directory.
Then check if tparse has been correctly installed: 
$ python

Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import tparse
>>> 
This is ok.

now move the tparse.so into your lib/rcsparse directory
