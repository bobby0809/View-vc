TODO ITEMS
----------
*) add Tamminen Eero's comments on how to make Linux directly execute
   the Python script. From email on Feb 19.
   [ add other examples, such as my /bin/sh hack or the teeny CGI stub 
     importing the bulk hack ]

*) insert rcs_path into PATH before calling "rcsdiff". rcsdiff might
   use "co" and needs to find it on the path.

*) show the "locked" flag (attach it to the LogEntry objects).
   Idea from Russell Gordon <russell@hoopscotch.dhs.org>

*) committing with a specific revision number:
   http://mailman.lyra.org/pipermail/viewcvs/2000q1/000008.html

*) add capability similar to cvs2cl.pl:
     http://mailman.lyra.org/pipermail/viewcvs/2000q2/000050.html
   suggestion from Chris Meyer <cmeyer@gatan.com>.

*) add a tree view of the directory structure (and files?)

*) include a ConfigParser.py to help older Python installations

*) add a check for the rcs programs/paths to viewcvs-install. clarify the
   dependency on RCS in the docs.

*) add a page that describes how to reach anonymous CVS for ViewCVS

*) have a "check" mode that verifies binaries are available on rcs_path

   -> alternately (probably?): use rcsparse rather than external tools

*) Make a link from the Check-In database's result page back to the
   repository such that a click on a result will warp you to the
   directory where the file clicked is contained in.  *)
   (from Gottfried.Ganssauge@HAUFE.DE)


KNOWN BUGS
----------
*) from Dieter Deyke, Jan 12: if the CVS revisions differ by just a
   keyword, then the diff output chokes.

*) no scroll bar in Netscape browser when you click "as text" on an
   HTML document.

*) time.timezone seems to not be available on some 1.5.2 installs
