INSTALLING VIEWCVS
------------------

1) To get viewcvs.cgi to work, make sure that you have Python 1.5.2
   installed and a webserver which is capable to execute cgi-scripts
   (either based on the .cgi extension, or by placing the script
   within a specific directory).

   You need to have RCS installed. Specifically, "rlog", "rcsdiff",
   and "co". This script was tested against RedHat's rcs-5.7-10.rpm

   Note, that the viewcvs.cgi-script needs to have READ-ONLY, physical
   access to the repository (or a copy of it).  Therefore, rsh/ssh or
   pserver access doesn't work yet.

2) Copy viewcvs.cgi to the cgi-script location of your web
   server. Edit the file for your specific configuration. In
   particular, examine the following configuration variables:

      cvs_roots
      rcs_path
      forbidden_modules
      mime_types_file

   If Python is not located in /usr/local/bin, then you'll need to
   edit the first line of the file.

   ViewCVS has not been tested on the Win32 platform.

3) That's it. Try it out.



IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS ...
------------------------

If you've trouble to make viewcvs.cgi work:

=== If nothing seems to work:

 o check if you can execute CGI-scripts (Apache needs to have an
   ScriptAlias /cgi-bin or cgi-script Handler defined). Try to 
   execute a simple CGI-script that often comes with the distribution
   of the webserver; locate the logfiles and try to find hints
   which explain the malfunction

 o view the entries in the webserver's error.log
 
 o make sure there is a trailing slash on the URL. for example:
 
     http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/
     
   (ViewCVS should perform a redirection to ensure this, but a report
    has indicated that it doesn't always do this... please send more
    of these bug reports if you run into this)

=== If viewcvs seems to work but doesn't show the expected result
    (Typical error: you can't see any files)

 o check whether the CGI-script has read-permissions to your
   CVS-Repository. The CGI-script often runs as the user 'nobody' 
   or 'httpd' ..

 o does viewcvs find your RCS utililties? (edit rcs_path)
