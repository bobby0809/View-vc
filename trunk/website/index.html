    <h1>ViewCVS: Viewing CVS Repositories</h1>

    <p>
      The ViewCVS software was inspired by
      <a href="http://linux.fh-heilbronn.de/~zeller/cgi/cvsweb.cgi"><i>cvsweb</i></a>
      (by <a href="mailto:zeller@think.de">Henner Zeller</a>).
      I wanted to make some changes and updates, but cvsweb was
      implemented in Perl (and rather poorly, IMO). So I undertook the 
      task to convert the software to Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      ViewCVS can browse directories, change logs, and specific
      revisions of files. It can display diffs between versions and
      show selections of files based on tags or branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      ViewCVS is currently at version 0.2. It is almost a straight
      port of the cvsweb script, but has had numerous cleanups and other
      modifications, based on some of Python's strengths. There is
      still some "badness" in there, but I've been working on flushing 
      that out, along with my work to start adding features. The
      functionality of ViewCVS is equal to that of cvsweb, minus the
      "annotation" support. Annotation requires read/write access to
      the CVS repository (at this time), and I believe that is a 
      Bad Thing to do. One of my tasks will be eliminating the
      read/write requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The software is available for download:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <a href="viewcvs-0.2.tar.gz">Version 0.2 of ViewCVS</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Of course, it is also available through ViewCVS itself:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <a href="/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/gjspy/viewcvs/">http://www.lyra.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/gjspy/viewcvs/</a>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      ViewCVS <font color=red>requires <strong>Python
	1.5.2</strong></font>.

      <dt><strong>I got an <code>AttributeError: urlencode</code></strong></dt>
      <dd>
	If you see the following traceback in your browser:
	<blockquote>
	  <pre>
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "/home/httpd/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi", line 2205, in ?
    main()
  File "/home/httpd/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi", line 2123, in main
    query_string = sticky_query(query_dict)
  File "/home/httpd/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi", line 444, in sticky_query
    bare_query = urllib.urlencode(sticky_dict)
AttributeError: urlencode
</pre>
	</blockquote>
	This is indicative of using an earlier version of
	Python. <code>urllib.urlencode()</code> was introduced in
	Python 1.5.2.
