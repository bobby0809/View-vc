    <h1>ViewCVS: Viewing CVS Repositories</h1>

    <p>
      The ViewCVS software was inspired by
      <a href="http://linux.fh-heilbronn.de/~zeller/cgi/cvsweb.cgi"><i>cvsweb</i></a>
      (by <a href="mailto:zeller@think.de">Henner Zeller</a>).
      I wanted to make some changes and updates, but cvsweb was
      implemented in Perl (and rather poorly, IMO). So I undertook the 
      task to convert the software to
      <a href="http://www.python.org/"><i>Python</i></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      ViewCVS can browse directories, change logs, and specific
      revisions of files. It can display diffs between versions and
      show selections of files based on tags or branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      ViewCVS is currently at version 0.4. It was a
      port of the cvsweb script, but has had numerous cleanups and other
      modifications, based on some of Python's strengths. There is
      still some "badness" in there, but I've been working on flushing 
      that out, along with a few new features. The
      functionality of ViewCVS is equal to that of cvsweb, minus the
      "annotation" support. Annotation requires read/write access to
      the CVS repository (at this time), and I believe that is a 
      Bad Thing to do. One of my tasks will be eliminating the
      read/write requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The software is available for download:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <a href="viewcvs-0.4.tar.gz">Version 0.4 of ViewCVS</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Of course, it is also available through ViewCVS itself:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <a href="/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/gjspy/viewcvs/">http://www.lyra.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/gjspy/viewcvs/</a>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      ViewCVS requires <strong>Python 1.5</strong> (which has been out 
      for a couple years and is readily available for your favorite
      operating system).

    <h2>Mailing List</h2>

    <p>
      If you have any comments, questions, suggestions, or patches,
      then please send them to the
      <a href="http://mailman.lyra.org/mailman/listinfo/viewcvs">ViewCVS
	mailing list</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional features over cvsweb</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Colorization for Python files</li>
      <li>Better reporting for unreadable files</li>
      <li>More robust when given varying <code>rcsdiff</code> or
	<code>rlog</code> outputs</li>
      <li>Hard breaks in human-readable diffs</li>
      <li>
	The configuration file is optional (you can change the values
	right in the CGI script and avoid the config file, if you so
	choose). The config file syntax is also cleaner, since it is
	human-manageable rather than source code.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Future features, coming soon:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>UI streamlining/simplification</li>
      <li>Integration with CVS checkin auto-mail scripts</li>
      <li>
	<i>Suggestions? Send mail to the
	  <a href="mailto:viewcvs@lyra.org">viewcvs@lyra.org</a>
	  mailing list.
	</i>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Longer term:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Annotation ("blame") support (similar to cvsweb)</li>
      <li>Integration with an indexer such as LXR</li>
      <li>Additional colorizers</li>
    </ul>

    <hr width="75&#37;">
    <h2>Colorization of Python files</h2>

    <p>
      Christophe Pelte suggested this feature: colorize Python source
      files using
      <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/lemburg/SoftwareDescriptions.html#py2html.py"><i>py2html</i></a>
      (by Marc-Andrew Lemburg, based on
      <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/just/code/PyFontify.py"><i>PyFontify</i></a>
      by Just van Rossum). I've added this feature to ViewCVS 0.3,
      along with a generalized plugin mechanism for custom coloring other
      types of files. See the instructions within the viewcvs.cgi for
      setting the <code>py2html_path</code> configuration variable if
      you want to use this feature.
