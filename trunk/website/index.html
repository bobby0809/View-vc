    <h1>ViewCVS: Viewing CVS Repositories</h1>

    <p>
      The ViewCVS software was inspired by
      <a href="http://linux.fh-heilbronn.de/~zeller/cgi/cvsweb.cgi"><i>cvsweb</i></a>
      (by <a href="mailto:zeller@think.de">Henner Zeller</a>).
      I wanted to make some changes and updates, but cvsweb was
      implemented in Perl (and rather poorly, IMO). So I undertook the 
      task to convert the software to Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      ViewCVS can browse directories, change logs, and specific
      revisions of files. It can display diffs between versions and
      show selections of files based on tags or branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      ViewCVS is currently at version 0.1. It is almost a straight
      port of the cvsweb script. I made some cleanups and other
      modifications, based on some of Python's strengths, but there
      is still some ugly stuff in there. Future revisions will clear
      that out, along with my work to start adding features. The
      functionality of ViewCVS is equal to that of cvsweb, minus the
      "annotation" support. Annotation requires read/write access to
      the CVS repository (at this time), and I believe that is a 
      Bad Thing to do. One of my tasks will be eliminating the
      read/write requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The software is available for download:

    <blockquote>
      <a href="viewcvs-0.1.tar.gz">Version 0.1 of ViewCVS</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ViewCVS <font color=red>requires <strong>Python
	1.5.2</strong></font>.

	If you see the following traceback in your browser:
	<blockquote>
	  <pre>
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "/home/httpd/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi", line 2205, in ?
    main()
  File "/home/httpd/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi", line 2123, in main

    bare_query = urllib.urlencode(sticky_dict)
AttributeError: urlencode

	</blockquote>
	This is indicative of using an earlier version of
	Python. <code>urllib.urlencode()</code> was introduced in
	Python 1.5.2.
