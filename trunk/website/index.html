    <h1>ViewCVS: Viewing CVS Repositories</h1>

    <p>
      The ViewCVS software was inspired by
      <a href="http://stud.fh-heilbronn.de/~zeller/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/"><i>cvsweb</i></a>
      (by <a href="mailto:zeller@think.de">Henner Zeller</a>).
      I wanted to make some changes and updates, but cvsweb was
      implemented in Perl (and rather poorly, IMO). So I undertook the 
      task to convert the software to
      <a href="http://www.python.org/"><i>Python</i></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      ViewCVS can browse directories, change logs, and specific
      revisions of files. It can display diffs between versions and
      show selections of files based on tags or branches. In addition, 
      ViewCVS has "annotation" or "blame" support, and the beginnings
      of Bonsai-like query facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      ViewCVS is currently at version 0.6. It was a port of the cvsweb
      script, but has had numerous cleanups and other modifications,
      based on some of Python's strengths. There is still some minor
      "badness" remaining from the Perl code, but I've been working on
      flushing that out, while adding new features. Currently, the
      functionality of ViewCVS surpasses that of cvsweb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The software is available for download:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <a href="viewcvs-0.6.tar.gz">Version 0.6 of ViewCVS</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Of course, it is also available through ViewCVS itself:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/viewcvs/">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/viewcvs/</a>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      ViewCVS requires <strong>Python 1.5</strong> (which has been out 
      for a couple years and is readily available for your favorite
      operating system). If you choose to use the SQL Checkin Database 
      feature, then you must use <strong>Python 1.5.2</strong> and the 
      <a href="http://dustman.net/andy/python/MySQLdb"><i>MySQLdb
	  module</i></a> installed.
    </p>

    <p>
      ViewCVS has been developed by the <a href="who.html">ViewCVS
	Group</a> and is made available under a
      <a href="license-1.html">BSD-type license</a>.

    <h2>Additional features over cvsweb</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>New to version 0.5:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Colorization for many file types via <code>enscript</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
	Bonsai-like query features.
      </li>
      <li>
	Annotation/blame support against a <strong>read-only</strong>
	repository.
      </li>
      <li>
	Configuration on a per-virtual-host basis. This allows you
	to share the configuration file and ViewCVS installation
	across virtual hosts, yet still be able to fine-tune the
	options when necessary.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Other improvements over cvsweb:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Better reporting for unreadable files.</li>
      <li>
	More robust when given varying <code>rcsdiff</code> or
	<code>rlog</code> outputs.
      </li>
      <li>Hard breaks in human-readable diffs.</li>
      <li>
	The configuration file is optional (you can change the values
	right in the CGI script and avoid the config file, if you so
	choose). The config file syntax is also cleaner, since it is
	human-manageable rather than source code.
      </li>
      <li>
	Directories with a large number of files can be viewed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Future features, coming soon:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>UI streamlining/simplification</li>
      <li>Integration with CVS checkin auto-mail scripts</li>
      <li>Tighter integration the query features</li>
      <li>
	<i>Suggestions? Send mail to the
	  <a href="mailto:viewcvs@lyra.org">viewcvs@lyra.org</a>
	  mailing list.
	</i>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Longer term:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integration with an indexer such as LXR</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Colorization of files</h2>
    <p>
      ViewCVS can make use of the <code>enscript</code> program to
      colorize files in the CVS repository. If <code>enscript</code>
      is present on your system, then set the
      <code>use_enscript</code> option in the
      <code>viewcvs.conf</code> configuration file. If necessary,
      update the <code>enscript_path</code> option to point to your
      installation directory. ... That's it! Now, as you view files
      through ViewCVS, they will be colored.
    </p>

    <h3>Colorization of Python files</h3>

    <p>
      ViewCVS currently comes with a builtin colorizer for Python
      source files. This may go away, given the new
      <code>enscript</code> support...
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe Pelte suggested this feature: colorize Python source
      files using
      <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/lemburg/SoftwareDescriptions.html#py2html.py"><i>py2html</i></a>
      (by Marc-Andrew Lemburg, based on
      <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/just/code/PyFontify.py"><i>PyFontify</i></a>
      by Just van Rossum). I've added this feature to ViewCVS 0.3,
      along with a generalized plugin mechanism for custom coloring other
      types of files. See the instructions within the viewcvs.cgi for
      setting the <code>py2html_path</code> configuration variable if
      you want to use this feature.
